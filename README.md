# Talking-Avatar
An application that based on volume shows one of two images: open.png or closed.png
I will be using this during ludum dare streaming to simulate a face-camera.

To use your own pictures simply replace open.png and closed.png with different image, making sure to keep the file name and extension the same.
The images must be in the same folder as the exe.
NAudio.dll must also be in the same folder as the exe.
